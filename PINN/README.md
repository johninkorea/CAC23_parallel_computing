# CAC23_parallel_computing

In this folder, you can find the PINN code that solve the physics problem.

forward.py : find the exact solution by train conditions.
forward_ray.py : find the \alpha value as think it is a hyperparameter.
inverse.py : find the exact solution and parameters using conditions + few data.
inverse_noise.py : find the exact solution and parameters using conditions + few noise data.
