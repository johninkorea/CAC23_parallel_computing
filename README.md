# CAC23_parallel_computing

This Repository is the record of the project what we done in 14th KIAS CAC Summer School.

We tried to solve the [damped harmonic oscillator](https://beltoforion.de/en/harmonic_oscillator/) problem with various methodologies.

First, you can see the [MPI](https://github.com/johninkorea/CAC23_parallel_computing/tree/main/MPI) code in 1_MPI forder. this purpose create exact solution to plot and train the network.

Second, [PINN](https://github.com/johninkorea/CAC23_parallel_computing/tree/main/PINN) is the code with Physics-Informed Neural Network to solve the ODE equation.

Last, I solve the same problem with the Bayesian Kernal and you can see the code in [Bayesian](https://github.com/johninkorea/CAC23_parallel_computing/tree/main/Bayesian) forder.
